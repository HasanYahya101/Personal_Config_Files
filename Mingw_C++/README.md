# VSCode MinGW C++ Configurations

The [`.vscode`](./.vscode) directory in this repository contains essential Visual Studio Code (VSCode) configurations for building, running, and debugging C++ code using the MinGW toolchain. Here's an overview of the files and their purposes:

- **`settings.json`**: This file contains Visual Studio Code settings tailored to your C++ development needs. It might include things like formatting preferences, code style, and other editor-specific settings. You can add things you Like.

- **`tasks.json`**: The `tasks.json` file defines build and compile tasks for your C++ projects. You can configure build commands, specify compiler flags, and set up other tasks necessary for your projects. I used it for Compiling Code in Debug and Release Mode.

- **`launch.json`**: The `launch.json` file is used to configure the debugging environment. It defines how to start debugging sessions, what executable to run, and any additional parameters required for debugging C++ code. You can use it for 3 Options, Run an Executable, Build an Executable and Debug Code.

- **Code Snippet**: In this folder, you will find a template which can be activated by typing `cpp` in your file.
