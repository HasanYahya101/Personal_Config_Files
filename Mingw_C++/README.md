## VSCode MinGW C++ Configurations

The [`.vscode`](./.vscode) directory in this repository contains essential Visual Studio Code (VSCode) configurations for building, running, and debugging C++ code using the MinGW toolchain. Here's an overview of the files and their purposes:

- **`settings.json`**: This file contains Visual Studio Code settings tailored to your C++ development needs. It might include things like formatting preferences, code style, and other editor-specific settings.

- **`tasks.json`**: The `tasks.json` file defines build and compile tasks for your C++ projects. You can configure build commands, specify compiler flags, and set up other tasks necessary for your projects.

- **`launch.json`**: The `launch.json` file is used to configure the debugging environment. It defines how to start debugging sessions, what executable to run, and any additional parameters required for debugging C++ code.

- **Code Snippet**: In this folder, you might find a code snippet file (e.g., `.cpp` or `.h`) that contains a pre-defined code template. This can be handy for quickly adding common code structures without having to write them from scratch.
